## **Ingredients**
---
Glacier is made with the following ingredients:

- Glacier's backend is powered by Firebase and its excellent Cloud Firestore.
- Glacier is built using React Native's barebones workflow, in order to take full advantage of more performant libraries and to avoid some of the bloat that comes along with Expo.
- Authentication is handled with the [react-native-google-signin](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-google-signin) library.
- glacier uses [react-native-firebase](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase) fore firebase interactions, as the javascript API does not function entirely in React Native.
